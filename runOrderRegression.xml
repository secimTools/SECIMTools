@TIP_AND_WARNING@

**What it does**

This tool uses linear regression to identify potential relationships between the order samples were run in and their values.  If a linear relationship with run order is identified, further exploration may be warranted.   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Input**

- Two input datasets are required.

    @WIDE@

    **NOTE:** The sample IDs must match the sample IDs in the Design File (below).
    Extra columns will automatically be ignored.


    @METADATA@

**In addition to your datasets, you need to provide:**

    **Unique Feature ID**

        - The column name in your wide dataset that contains the unique IDs for
          your features. In our example dataset you would input *Feature*.

    @GROUP@

    **Run Order ID**

        - The column name in your Design file that contains the order samples were
          run.

        **NOTE:** Groups with one element will be excluded from the test.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Output Files**

- This tool outputs 2 different files:

    **runOrder_PDF** is a PDF containing the regression plots, one plot for each
    feature, where the x-axis is run order and the y-axis is value.  Only plots
    where the p- value was less than 0.05 are output as PDFs given that the
    prediction is no linear association of run order with value (i.e., slope = 0).
    Features with a significant p-value are candidates for further investigation.

    The regression for Tyrosine is shown above. The values for each sample is
    plotted as a blue data point. They cyan colored line is the regression line
    with a slope of 0.193 and an R^2 0.165. Red lines indicate the confidence
    interval around the slope of the regression line.


    **runOrder_TSV** is a TSV file containing the regression summary information
    (slope, p-value and rSquared) in addtion to a 0/1 indicator flag for a
    signficant regression at a nominal p-value of (i) 0.05 and (ii) 0.10.
